  (description
   "guile-xmlrpc is an XMLRPC module for Guile. Guile comes with the"
   "wonderful sxml module that allows XML document creation and"
   "parsing. guile-xmlrpc goes one step further and combines sxml with"
   "some macros and procedures that simplifies even more the creation"
   "and parsing of XMLRPC documents. It complies with the"
   "http://xmlrpc.com specification and is released under the GPLv3.")
